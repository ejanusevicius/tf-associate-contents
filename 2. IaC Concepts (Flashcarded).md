### What is Infrastructure as Code? +
Process of managing cloud infrastructure using human-readable configuration files. It is used to automate, create, update and destroy infrastructure.
### What are some drawbacks of Manual Configuration?
* Misconfiguration of services due to human-error.
* Hard to manage expected infrastructure state for compliance.
* Hard to transfer configuration knowledge to other team members.
### What are some benefits of IaC? +
* IaC can act as a blueprint of your infrastructure.
* IaC allows us to share and version the infrastructure.
### Explain Declarative IaC Tools +
**Declarative** tools are explicit in what is being provisioned, it is more verbose but has no chance of mis-configuration and uses languages such as JSON, YAML, XML.

### Explain Imperative IaC Tools +
**Imperative** tools are **implicit** as only what is required infrastructure is described and the rest is filled in. It is less verbose but may lead to mis-configuration. It leverages `SDKs` of a specific cloud to provision the infrastructure and uses programming languages for that e.g. Python, Ruby, JavaScript.

### Where is Terraform on the Declarative/Imperative IaC Tool spectrum? +
Terraform sits in the middle as it uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) which supports some imperative-like features such as **loops**, **dynamic** **blocks**, **locals** and has some data structures such as **maps** and **collections**.

### What is Infrastructure Lifecycle? +
Clearly defined work phases used by DevOps to plan, design, build, test, deliver, maintain and retire cloud infrastructure.
### What is Day 0, Day 2, Day 2 Infrastructure Lifecycle? +
A broad way of defining Infrastructure Lifecycle (days DO NOT mean 24 hours):
* Day 0 - Plan and Design
* Day 1 - Develop and iterate
* Day 2 - Go live and maintain
### What are the advantages of IaC? +
* Reliability - **IaC** makes changes **idempotent**, consistent, repeatable and predictable.
	* **Itempotent** - no matter how many times IaC tool is ran the output will be exactly the same as per configuration defined.
* Manageability - enables mutation via code and requires minimal changes to tweak.
* Sensibility - helps avoid financial, reputational losses even life loss when considered in a context of the military or government.
### How does Itempotent vs Non-idempotent IaC tools work? +
* Non-idempotent - running a configuration that provisions 2 VMs twice will result in 4 VMs as each run will add two 2 VMs like defined in the configuration file.
* Idempotent - running the same configuration twice will only result in 2 VMs in the end as defined by idempotency.

### What is the difference between Provisioning, Deployment and Orchestration? +
These terms have overlapping responsibilities but are slightly different:

Provisioning - preparing a server with systems, data and software and make it ready for network operations i.e. it's **launching and configuring a server**. Uses tools like Puppet, Ansible, Chef, Bash scripts, etc.

Deployment - act of delivering of a version of an application to run on a provisioned server. Uses tools like AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.

Orchestration - act of coordinating multiple systems or services. It's also a common term when working with microservices and containers. Uses tools like Kubernetes, Salt, Fabric.

### Explain Configuration Drift +
Configuration Drift is when provisioned infrastructure has unexpected configuration change due to:
* team members manually adjusting the configuration
* malicious actors
* side effects from APIs, SDKs and CLIs.

### How to detect configuration drift? +
* Use a compliance tool such as AWS Config, Azure Policies, GCP Security Health Metrics.
* Built-in support for drift detection e.g. AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection.
* Storing the expected state if using Terraform.
### How to correct configuration drift? +
* A compliance tool that can remediate misconfig e.g AWS Config.
* Terraform refresh and plan commands
* Manually correcting the configuration (not recommended)
* Tearing down and setting up the infrastructure again..
### How to prevent configuration drift? +
* Use Immutable infrastructure, always create and destroy, never re-use.
	* Utilise Blue Green Deployments.
	* Policy of not modifying servers after deployment
	* Using Golden AMIs or containers using AWS Image Builder or HashiCorp Packer.
* Using GitOps to version control our IaC and peer review every single change via a Pull Request.
### What are the differences between Immutable and Mutable Infrastructure? +

Mutable Infrastructure - can occur when a server is configured using a tool like Ansible, Chef, etc. This method does not guarantee that the configuration will never be changed.

Immutable Infrastructure - a VM is launched, provisioned and then it is turned into a Virtual Image and stored into a repository. Afterwards the image is used to deploy VM Instances. This makes the VMs consistent and immutable.

### Explain GitOps in the context of Infrastructure as Code +
GitOps - taking Infrastructure as Code and using a Git repository to introduce a formal process to review and accept changes to the infrastructure. Once a change is approved it is automatically deployed.

### What is HashiCorp? +
HashiCorp (HCP) - company that manages open-source tools used to support development and deployment of large-scale service-oriented software installations.

HCP Services are cloud-agnostic and have providers for all major cloud service providers and are suited for multi-cloud workloads.
### What is HashiCorp Boundary? +
