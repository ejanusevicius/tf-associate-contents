### Terraform domains
**DOMAINS ARE NOT WEIGHTED (unknown split between sections):**
1. Understand infrastructure as code (IaC) concepts
	1. Explain what IaC is
	2. Describe advantages of IaC patterns
2. Understand the purpose of Terraform (vs other IaC)
	1. Explain multi-cloud and provider-agnostic benefits
	2. Explain benefits of state
3. Understand Terraform basics
	1. Install and version Terraform providers
	2. Describe plugin-based architecture
	3. Write Terraform configuration using multiple providers
4. Use Terraform outside of core workflow
	1. Describe when to use `terraform import` to import existing infrastructure into your Terraform state
	2. Use `terraform state` to view Terraform state
	3. Describe when to enabled verbose logging and what the outcome/value is
5. Interact with Terraform modules
	1. Contrast and use different module source options including the public Terraform Module Registry.
	2. Interact with module inputs and outputs.
	3. Describe variable scope within modules and child modules
	4. Set module version
6. Use the core Terraform workflow
	1. Describe Terraform workflow `(Write => Plan => Create)`
	2. Initialize a Terraform working directory `(terraform init)`
	3. Validate a Terraform configuration `(terraform validate)`
	4. Generate and review an execution plan for Terraform `(terraform plan)`
	5. Execute changes to infrastructure with Terraform `(terraform apply)`
	6. Applying formatting and style adjustments to configuration `(terraform fmt)`
7. Implement and maintain state
	1. Describe default `local` backend
	2. Describe state locking
	3. Handle backend and cloud integration authentication methods
	4. Differentiate remote state back-end options
	5. Manage resource drift and Terraform state
	6. Describe `backend` block and cloud integration in configuration
	7. Understand secret management in state files
8. Read, generate and modify configuration
	1. Demonstrate use of variables and outputs
	2. Describe secure secret injection best practice(s)
	3. Understand the use of collection and structural types
	4. Create and differentiate `resource` and `data` configuration
	5. Use resource addressing and resource parameters to connect resources together
	6. Use HCL and Terraform functions to write configuration
	7. Describe built-in dependency management (order of execution based)
9. Understand **Terraform Cloud** capabilities
	1. Explain how Terraform Cloud helps to manage infrastructure
	2. Describe howTerraform Cloud enables collaboration and governance
### Exam changes from 002 to 003
* `local-execute` and `remote-execute`
* Instead of `null_resource` use `terraform_dat`a
* `terraform taint` has been replaced with `-replace` flag for `terraform plan`
* `terraform refresh` has been replaced with `refresh-only` flag for `terraform plan`
* Terraform workspace is no longer in the exam.
* You need to know how to mark data as sensitive
* Terraform Cloud has a new UI
* Connecting to Terraform Cloud now uses the cloud block instead of remote block.
### Version 003 Considerations
* The versions of Terraform and Providers are differents between 002 and 003.
	* When using a provider use the version `~> 5.0`
	* Terraform is 1.6.5
### Additional Nuggets of Knowledge:
* Terraform does not provide infrastructure state management (unless Terraform Cloud is used).
	* Services such as AWS CloudFormation offers state handling as part of the service.
* Terraform Best Practices: www.terraform-best-practices.com - an open-source book about Terraform Best Practices.
* www.semver.org is a good read on Semantic Versioning.
* ISO 8601 vs RFC 3339 time formats: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/522251/whats-the-difference-between-iso-8601-and-rfc-3339-date-formats.
