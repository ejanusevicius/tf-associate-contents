### Explain Policy as Code
`Policy as Code` - automating regulatory or governance policies via code.
### Explain Sentinel
Embedded Policy-as-Code framework integrated with Terraform Platform. It is a paid service that is part of Team & Governance upgrade package.
### What are some features of Sentinel?
* **Embedded** - enables policy enforcement in the data path to actively reject violating behaviour instead of passively detecting.
* **Fine-grained, condition based policy** - make policy decisions based on the condition of other values.
* **Multiple Enforcement Levels** - advisory, soft and hard-mandatory levels allow policy writers to warn or reject behaviour.
* **External Information** - source external information to make holistic policy decisions.
* **Multi-Cloud Compatible** - ensure infrastructure are within business and regulatory policy across multiple providers.
### What are benefits of Policy as Code?
* **Sandboxing** - ability to create guardrails to avoid dangerous actions or remove the need to manual verification.
* **Codification** - policies are well documented and explicitly represent what is enforced.
* **Version** **Control** - easy to modify or iterate on policies with a chain of history of changes over time.
* **Testing** - syntax and behaviour can be easily validated with Sentinel ensuring policies are configured as expected.
* **Automation** - enables integration of policies in various system to auto-remediate or notify.
### Explain Sentinel Language
* All Sentinel Policies are written in Sentinel language that is designed to be non-programmer and programmer friendly, embeddable and safe.

### How does Sentinel work with Terraform?
Sentinel can be integrated with Terraform via Terraform Cloud as part of your IaC provisioning pipeline.

### Explain HashiCorp Packer
`Packer` - developer tool to provision build images (e.g. Golden AMIs) that will be stored in a repository. This allows us to build our image before deploying.

### What are the benefits of pre-building images?
* Immutable infrastructure
* Configuration is consistent across all VMs in the fleet.
* Faster deployments.
* Earlier detection of package changes and deprecation of old tech.
### How does HashiCorp Packer work?
Packer configures a machine or container via Packer Template.
* Packer templates use HCL

### Explain Consul
Consul - service networking platform which provides:
* Service discovery - central registry for all services in the network.
* Service mesh - managing network traffic between services (comms layer on top of your container application)
* Application configuration capabilities

### Explain Vault
Vault - tool for securely accessing secrets from multiple secret datastores. It provides a unified interface to any secret e.g. AWS Secrets, Consul Key Store, Google Cloud KMS, Azure Service Principles, etc.
### How does Vault work?
Vault is deployed to a server where:
* Vault admins can directly manage secrets
* Operators (developers) can access secrets via an API.

### How does Terraform and Vault work together?
Instead of storing credentials on the machine which can become an attack vector, vault can be used to inject a short-lived secrets at run-time. This limits the "attack surface".
![[Pasted image 20231204162434.png]]
This requires the following:
* Vault server provisioned and vault engine configured e.g. AWS Secret Engine.
* Vault will create a machine user for AWS and generate the short-live credentials from the machine user.
* Vault will manage and apply the appropriate AWS Policies.
